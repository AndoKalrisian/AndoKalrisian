### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Anders](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anders-bergman-39660211/), a Data Engineer. I'm passionate about how data can be leveraged to empower analysts, data scientists and stakeholders to discover valuable insights and also how it can be used to automate decision making.  

I'm currently working on a client project that is an event-driven architecture that utilizes various blockchain(cryptocurrency) and NFT market data to automate decision making.  

I'm also currently seeking a new role or contract as my current contract is wrapping up soon.  If you would like to contact me with an opportunity or would like to collaborate on a project you can send me an email at **digilan2005(at)gmail.com**.
