### Hi there 👋

I'm [Anders](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anders-bergman-39660211/), I'm a game programmer who loves solving technical problems and building systems that make games fun to play.

## What Gets Me Excited

I'm drawn to the technical challenges in game development—figuring out how to architect clean, maintainable systems that can handle complexity without falling apart. Whether it's designing a flexible stat modifier system, optimizing spawn patterns, or building UI frameworks that don't make designers cry, I enjoy the puzzle-solving aspect of making games work smoothly.

## What I Build With

Mostly **Unity3D** and **C#** these days, with a healthy dose of **Python** for when I need to wrangle data or automate things. I like dependency injection, data-driven design, and writing code that future-me won't hate.

## Background

I've spent over a decade making games across mobile, console, and PC—everything from AAA titles like Metroid Prime: Federation Force and Tron: Evolution to mobile F2P games. Started in UI/UX, transitioned into engineering because I wanted to get closer to the systems that make games tick.

## Philosophy

Good games come from sustainable teams. I believe in clean code, helpful documentation, and working at a sustainable pace. No crunch, just consistent progress on interesting problems.

Always learning. Always building. Always curious about how things work under the hood.
